the stm32f103 used in the development board named blue pill
  -it is a development board designed by st electronics
  -it can be programmed it two ways mainly 
      1. using STlink as debugger or programmer
      1. using ftdi (an usb to serial converter)
         other usb to serial converter can be used too but need
         to check first
  - stm32 cubeIDE and arduiono are two ide to program the board. Here
    the cubeIDE should be choosen 


there some informative datasheet from their website , some of them are
well presented and easily understandable (one is the general overview 
on internal and external about mcu, another one is datasheet) . those 
sould be read to gain the knowledge and overview about the mcu and 
programming.    Also there are some pdf tutorial from third party. those
should be checked out too.


the ST weblink--https://blog.st.com/stm32-step-by-step-tutorial/ and 
https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/STM32StepByStep:STM32_step_by_step_overview
can be used for tutorials. the simple roadmap according to their site can be
--it will teach readers how to set up their MCU, launch a blinking light
 application, then present critical concepts such as UART, sensors, and
 mobile apps using Bluetooth.--
